# bg-analyzer

## Overview
BG-Analyzer is a side project born out of my recent Type 1 diabetes diagnosis. Its aim is to provide data-driven insights into Insulin-to-Carbohydrate Ratios (ICR) and Insulin Correction Factors (ICF) by leveraging dynamic data analysis.

## Status: Work in Progress ðŸš§
This tool is currently under development, and being a personal journey, it's evolving based on experiences and learnings. Feedback and insights are always welcome as they can provide valuable directions for improvement.

## Goals
- Assist users like myself in understanding and managing diabetes more effectively.
- Use real-world data to offer suggestions for personalized insulin dosage.
- Create a tool that's adaptable and reflects the diverse experiences of those with Type 1 diabetes.
